    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a very persistent, proactive, dynamic and determined individual who 
        keeps trying to evolve his personal and professional skills in order to 
        be prepared to face any challenge, but I'm also someone who's always 
        available to helpout his fellow team members whenever they require some 
        assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment my main professional focus and interest lies in Embedded 
        Software Test Engineering and Full-Stack Web Development, with a huge
        ambition and determination to work and grow in either of these fields.
